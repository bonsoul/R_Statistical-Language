#The Assignment
#Global HIV Trend: Visualize HIV case trends in countries contributing to 75% of the global burden.

#Regional HIV Trend: Visualize HIV case trends in countries contributing to 75% of the burden within each WHO region.

#Poverty-HIV Analysis: Merge HIV and World Bank multidimensional poverty data, then analyze the relationship between HIV prevalence and multidimensional poverty (including individual components), accounting for random effects by country and year.

#Key Observations:


#South Africa has the highest estimated HIV cases, rising from approximately 4 million in 2000 to nearly 8 million in 2021. This reflects a consistently increasing trend, indicating a significant public health burden.

#Nigeria and Mozambique show notable increases in HIV cases, though not as steep as South Africa. By 2021, both countries are approaching or exceeding 2 million estimated cases.

#Countries like Ethiopia, Kenya, Zimbabwe, and Thailand show either a plateau or slight decline in HIV cases over time, suggesting progress in managing the epidemic or slower growth in new infections.

#Uganda, Zambia, and the United Republic of Tanzania have moderate but steady increases in HIV cases, indicating ongoing transmission but potentially better access to care and surveillance.

#Countries like CÃ´te d'Ivoire, Malawi, and the Democratic Republic of the Congo have comparatively lower case estimates, though their trends are relatively flat or slowly increasing.

#1. AFR (Africa Region)

#This region shows the highest number of HIV cases, particularly in countries like South Africa, Nigeria, Mozambique, Zambia, Uganda, Zimbabwe, and the United Republic of Tanzania.The trend is steadily increasing or stabilizing at a high level, indicating a sustained burden.

#2. AMR (Americas Region)

#Countries like Brazil, Mexico, Argentina, Colombia, and Venezuela show lower HIV case numbers compared to Africa.Trends are relatively stable with minor increases over time.

#3. EMR (Eastern Mediterranean Region)

#Includes countries like Iran, Egypt, and Pakistan, showing low and stable case counts over time.

#4. EUR (European Region)

#Countries like Russia, Ukraine, and Portugal have moderate case counts.Ukraine shows a notable upward trend, while other countries remain stable.

#5. SEAR (South-East Asia Region)

#Includes India, Indonesia, and Thailand.India stands out with higher cases, though growth appears to plateau.

#6. WPR (Western Pacific Region)

#Countries such as China, Vietnam, and the Philippines show moderate to low case numbers.Slight increases are visible, but the overall burden is much less than in Africa.

#Findings

#Country-level variability is substantial (StdDev = 245,963.7), indicating that HIV levels differ significantly across countries.

#Period within country (i.e., year-to-year variation within a country) also shows non-trivial variability (StdDev = 56,052.1), as does the residual (35,763.85).

#Electricity vs. Poverty Headcount Ratio (-0.799): Areas with more electricity access tend to have much lower poverty.

#Educational Enrollment vs. Attainment (-0.495): Overlap is expected, but should be monitored for multicollinearity.

#Poverty Headcount Ratio is likely a significant positive predictor of HIV cases, aligning with your earlier correlation matrix (0.41).

#Electricity, Sanitation, and Drinking Water may be meaningful contributors, given their moderate correlations with HIV.

#Education seems to have weaker associations, especially Educational Enrollment, which had near-zero correlation with HIV cases in earlier analysis.

#mmary of Findings:

#HIV prevalence is significantly affected by country and year-level differences, as shown by the large random effect variances.

#Poverty and infrastructure (electricity, water, sanitation) appear to have stronger influence on HIV prevalence.

#Education is less clearly related, and potentially impacted by multicollinearity.



# Question2

#You have been provided with data on the under-five mortality rate and neonatal mortality rate for the African region, which has been downloaded from the UN Inter-agency Group for Child Mortality Estimation. Your task is to:
#Filter data for the eight countries belonging to the East African Community (list here: https://www.eac.int/overview-of-eac) 
#Visualize the latest estimate of each indicator at the country level using shapefiles, which can be downloaded from www.gadm.org. 
#Show the average trends in the mortality rates over time (plot the average trend line and add the points in the graphic for the country level estimates for each indicator. Expectation: two plots).
#Based on your visualizations, identify the countries with the highest under-five mortality rates in East Africa and the highest neonatal mortality.

#Moderate Rates:

#Areas shaded in teal to light blue (e.g., northern Kenya, Ethiopia) have moderate mortality rates, between 30 and 50 deaths per 1,000.

#Uganda, Rwanda, Tanzania, and Kenya (especially southern regions) are shaded in dark purple, suggesting lower neonatal mortality, closer to 20 deaths per 1,000.

#Key Findings from the Map:
#High Mortality Rates (Green to Yellow shades â 400 to 600+ deaths/1,000):Northern South Sudan and possibly parts of Somalia show the highest under-five mortality rates.

#These areas are shaded in green to yellow, indicating mortality rates above 400 and possibly over 600 per 1,000 live births â exceptionally high and indicative of a severe public health crisis.

#Moderately High Mortality (Blue-green shades â ~200â400 deaths/1,000):Central and Western South Sudan, Eastern DRC, and northwestern regions of Uganda and Kenya show moderately high rates.

#These regions are shaded in darker teal or green-blue, signaling persistently high child mortality.

#Lower Mortality Rates (Purple shades â below 200 deaths/1,000):

#Rwanda, Kenya (southern and coastal parts), Tanzania, and most of Uganda show lower under-five mortality, shaded in dark purple.

#These areas reflect relatively better child survival rates, likely due to stronger health systems and broader health interventions.
