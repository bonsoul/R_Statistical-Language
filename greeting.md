I can analyze data from the 2024 NFL season (and soon 2025). When asking about teams, you can use 2- or 3-letter abbreviations such as NYG and SF. You can ask me questions such as

- **Filter and Sort Table**
    - <span class="suggestion">Show only SF games</span>
    - <span class="suggestion">Show only PHI home games</span>
    - <span class="suggestion">Sort table by largest difference in home & away scores</span>    

- **Answer Questions**
    - <span class="suggestion">How did KC do in night games?</span>
    - <span class="suggestion">What was MIA's won-loss record in games under 40 degrees?</span>
